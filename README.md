# WeatherApp
Weather application built with react native and Weather API.

This app was built to get an understanding on how ReactNative works and what are its features. Now that I have finished it, I would probably start it differently.

The main code can be found inside /screens/HomeScreen.js, because I wanted to do a navigation, even tho it is only a one page app, just to learn how to do the navigation inside of ReactNative.

The app itself is simple, at the top there is just a text that shows the currently showing city, then we have an icon of the current weather (sunny, foggy...), under we also have the degrees and current weather in text.
After that we show the wind speed, chance of rain and sunrise time.
Under all of  that we have a Daily forecast, that shows the forecast for the next 7 days.

Also implemented the search function, that shows the possible cities after at least 3 letters have been entered.
