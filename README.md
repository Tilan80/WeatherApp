# WeatherApp
Weather application built with react native and Weather API.

This weather application, developed using React Native and the Weather API, serves as a practical exploration of React Native's functionality and features. Through the development process, insights into React Native's capabilities were gained, leading to a deeper understanding of mobile app development.

## Key Features
Navigation Implementation: Despite being a one-page app, the project includes navigation, demonstrating proficiency in React Native navigation concepts. The primary codebase resides in /screens/HomeScreen.js.

Simple and Intuitive Design: The app features a straightforward design with essential weather information presented in a clear and intuitive manner. The user interface includes the currently displayed city, an icon representing the current weather conditions, temperature, wind speed, chance of rain, and sunrise time.

Daily Forecast: A comprehensive daily forecast for the upcoming 7 days is provided, offering users a quick overview of the week's weather outlook.

Search Functionality: The app incorporates a search function that dynamically suggests possible cities as the user enters at least three letters. This feature enhances user experience by simplifying the process of selecting and viewing weather information for different locations.

## Project Structure
/screens/HomeScreen.js: The primary code for the application is located here, emphasizing navigation within React Native.
## Future Considerations
Having completed the initial development phase, future iterations of the app could involve enhancements in terms of user interface, additional features, and optimizations for a more polished and user-friendly experience.
